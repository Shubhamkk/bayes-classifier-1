# bayes-classifier-1
Python program for the  bayes classifier by taking different types of Covariance matrix on both artificial as well as real data sets. It is assumed that all these datasets are coming from a guassian distribution. Four different cases of Covariance matrix has been taken for all the three types of datasets. Data are classified taking two classes at a time. So, there are total four classifiers and thirty six different classifications.
